[ApacheCon North America will be held 24-27 September 2018 in Montreal!](https://apachecon.com/acna18/)

ApacheCon is the official conference of the Apache Software Foundation. ApacheCon, in common with all Apache events, 
exists to support, develop and grow our communities. At ApacheCon, current and future users, along with those who build
on top of the software produced by the foundation, have the chance to learn from the developers and experts behind our
projects, software and community. It provides a chance to expand your knowledge, learn about current and future projects,
share what you known on software, development and community, and brings people together to celebrate the best of the
foundation and what it produces.
